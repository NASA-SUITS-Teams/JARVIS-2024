# JARVIS 2024

## Code Standard & Conventions

No initial work should ever be done on `master`. Merges to master will be handled by the team lead and the designated reviewers for any feature or module. For all practical purposes, all development will be done on a branch with a name prefixed by `dev/` -- see the branch `dev/gsingh_dev`.

For those unfamiliar with Git and Github, that process will lok something like this:

```

git branch dev/[your_branch_name]
git checkout dev/[your_branch_name]
...[make changes]...
git add [your changed files]
git commit -m "[your commit message]"
git push origin dev/[your_branch_name]

```
