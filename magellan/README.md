# Magellan

Magellan is the module that handles all pathfinding-related tasks. It will take in input from the TSS and other peripherals to generate optimal-path predictions. (If you're wondering about the name, Vasco (da Gama) was a close second. Circumnavigating the globe is pretty cool, even if you die along the way and don't actually make it back.)
